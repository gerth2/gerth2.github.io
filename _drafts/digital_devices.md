## On Word Problems

As engineers, we almost always start with word problems. You know those paragraphs that your math teacher writes out that you have to *read* and then they make you extract the useful information to formulate some formulas, then solve them, then get the actual answer? Yea, those. I used to love those, because the paragraph-format meant the teacher couldn't fit as many problems on one page, which meant shorter homework assignments!

Never in my professional life have I ever been asked "what's $$465 + 236$$?". Many times, I've had someone come to my desk and ask me a question that took ten sentences to explain, but at the end of the day all I had to do was calculate $$465 + 236$$. That and listen to them, which is a whole skill (nay, art?) unto itself.

In previous posts, we've seen how logic gates can be combined to manipulate bits. There's obviously a ton of different ways you could combine a set of bits... OR'ing them together, AND'ing them together, some combination of the two... But, why would you do such things?

Word problems. Every engineering problem starts as a word problem. So to learn about digital devices, we're going to frame a couple word problems. Some of them may seem a bit odd at first, but I promise they're building up to something very useful. Keep in mind, we're laying the foundation for understanding the guts of a computer, which is going to help us write better software.

## Rocket Launch Controller

Well, a contrived one at least. Part of one, not the whole thing. 

Control room must have two people who can initiate "go to launch"
Astronauts in capsule have kill switches to stop the launch if they see something wrong.
