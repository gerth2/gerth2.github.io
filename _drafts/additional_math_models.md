## Introduction

## Practical Example - Lead Acid Battery

output voltage = current draw & internal discharge params

## Practical Example - Pneumatics System

### Compressor & Storage Tank

compressor provides volumetric flow as a function of pressure

Tank has pressure as a function of total moles of air (integral of volumetric flow over time)

### Pneumatic Cylinder

volumetric flow as a function of volume change

Volume change as a function of piston position

piston position as a function of force acting on the rod (both from pressure and external force)
