## Introduction

I've been wanting to make this post since I started writing this blog. It's been on the potential ideas list for some time. It is simultaneously _less_ and _more_ important than any other post on this site. It simultaneously has _nothing_ to do with robotics, and _everything_ to do with robotics.

## Having Other Hobbies

So let's assume you're starting to get the hang of this FIRST robotics thing. You've done a competition season, and are looking to do more. You want to work a different subteam, win a new award, build something your team has never tried before. You have ambition! This is most certanly a good thing. I've been there, and it's an amazing feeling. Not only are you on the verge of doing excellent things, but you _want_ to go do them.

The best advice I can give anyone in this role? _Make the ambition sustainable_. 

This will likely mean something slightly different from person to person, but one common thread that I totally subscribe to - _find a hobby outside robotics_.

I write software for a living, for volunteer work with an FRC team, to maintain my home's infrastructure, and to educate folks online. Software consumes a large part of my time.

But, like any technical skill, software can never be an end unto itself. It always serves some broader purpose. You can study the skill, but knowing how to look for and work with that broader purpose is also extremely important.

So take some time off from the hard technical skills. Talk to your friends about casual topics. About your feelings. 

Search for truth in all aspects. Study philosophy and religion - knowing how humanity has approached truth through the ages will inform how you search for it in your own life. The late Woodie Flowers describes the need for us to each have a "complex definition of fairness" - much more of a complex definition than you get with your nose stuck in a physics textbook.

Learning these things comes, fundamentally, from doing non-robotics things. Private study, and interaction with others, is absolutely a key way to learn.

I have a personal hobby I want to tell you about - _making food_. Cooking is my other main passtime. Enjoyed by both my tastebuds and my wife, I want to spend a blog post telling you about my love for food, and giving some cooking advice along the way.
