*“Invention is the most important product of man's creative brain. The ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of human nature to human needs.” ― Nikola Tesla*

Computers and robots are both electronic devices, so it is worthwhile to start with some basic background on this force of nature we are using to do computation, movement, and other forms of useful work.

## What is Electricity

"Electric Charge" is a physical property of some matter, just like mass, or magnetism. Within an atom, the protons will have a positive charge, and electrons will have a negative charge. Electric charges interact with each other, and will exert mechanical forces on each other, which can cause motion. Just like in many things, opposites attract - negative charges tend to move toward positive charges, and vice versa. 

In robotics, "electricity" usually refers to the flow of charge from one point to another.
