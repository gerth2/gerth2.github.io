## Introduction

This post is going to be like the ending of a Hallmark movie. If you've been even mildly following so far, you could have predicted it from a mile away. What we're about to do is show how C code gets transformed into x86 assembly. With this keystone topic in place we now see the full cascade:

1. C syntax is built into assembly instructions
2. Assembly instructions are built into bits
3. Bits are loaded into RAM
4. RAM is used to evolve the state of registers in a processor over time
5. Registers in the processor, and the logic gluing them together, are built up from logic gates
6. Logic gates are built up from transistors
7. Transistors are analog electrical components that follow basic laws of physics

With this capstone, you'll have a _very_ good grasp of the same background knowledge that's sitting inside my head as I write code. Not all the knowledge, and not all the answers for sure - but you'll know enough to _know how to ask questions_. This is probably the biggest thing I run into while doing technical work. For better or worse, _you don't know what you don't know_. It's impossible to get all the knowledge into your head at once. What you do want to get into your head is a framework for how things work - this way, when it matters, you know what to go look up - how to start a search for the info you actually need. We'll always have textbooks and the Internet for that.

Finding the answer is easy. Finding the question is hard.
