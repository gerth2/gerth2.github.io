        <p>I have decided to start writing a blog. I think I’m about ten years late to the party. It’s new for me, but it seems like blogs are a dime a dozen nowadays. Standing out in this vast landscape is a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>Then again, I’m not sure I need to stand out.</p>

<p>Content-wise, I’ve got a plan. For now, we’ll be discussing software, and its development, in the context of the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>. A few other musings here and there, on leadership and life in general.</p>

<p>In particular, I want to try a bottom-up approach to teaching software here. I’ve seen a top-down that starts with Python, discussing syntax and jumps right into small projects. I think this is great for getting up and running quickly, but can miss lots of the subtle details that drive <em>why</em> things are the way they are. Bottom up isn’t required, but it provides a much better base for digging deep into concepts.</p>

<p>I’ve hoping to document things that I know, and things that I think, in the hopes others will benefit from them. There’s little that will be brand new here. Indeed, most of the knowledge I have came from others before me. Perhaps a new spin here or there, but nothing groundbreaking.</p>

<p>Again though, groundbreaking isn’t what you have to be all the time.</p>

<p>The material won’t be absolute basics - I want to dive a bit deeper. If this is the middle of build season, and you’re looking for “how do I make this thing move”, this resource probably won’t be all that helpful. Something like the <a href="https://www.thecompassalliance.org/Pathways/Programming">Compass Alliance</a> or similar might be a better resource for you.</p>

<p>Take some time to dig into these topics, it’s well worth the adventure.</p>

<p>Warmest greetings and welcome! However you have found your way here, thank you for reading!</p>
